     <p>✶High School: I am currently (2022-2023) a Junior at Freehold High School, NJ. I take multiple AP and Honors Courses including the Web Design Program which I enrolled into before the beginning of Sophmore Year thanks to insight from my Vice Principal John Hein.</p>
    <p>✶Enrolling into Web Design: When I first searched up what are the components of Web Design it says... "Web design encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production and maintenance of websites. The different areas of web design include web graphic design; user interface design; authoring, including standardised code and proprietary software; user experience design; and search engine optimization" I thought this would be a great idea to learn how to plan and arrange content on a website so that it can be shared and accessed online with the world.</p>
    <p>✶My Experience: I have been enrolled into the Web Design Program for two years (Sophmore and Junior) and plan on taking it next year to complete the 3 full years that the school gives you as a student. I have a basic understaiding of languages such as (HTML, CSS, JS) and the program has helped me become a better coder. </p>
