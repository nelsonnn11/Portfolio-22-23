    <p>✶Designing Websites: I am constantly designing websites throughout the school year. I have learned that a well-designed website can help you form a good impression on your peers/teachers and even consumers. It can also help you become more experienced with coding. But, more importantly, it provides good user experience and helps your website visitors access and navigate your website with ease.</p>
    <p>✶Doing projects: During the school year our teacher assigns us multiple projects to complete in a certain time-span. My Projects can be found in the project tab. Projects have been able to exapnd my understaiding of languages (HTML, CSS, JS) and become a better coder. </p>
    <p>✶Graphic Design: Is very interesting, it involves projecting visual communications intended to transmit specific messages to social groups, with specific objectives. Graphic design is an interdisciplinary branch of design and of the fine arts. Graphic Design is a way to express your own creativity. Personally I enjoy being able to plan out projects and choosing color palletes.</p>
